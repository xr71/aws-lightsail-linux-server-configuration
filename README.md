_hostname_:   ec2-18-191-144-56.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com  
_ip address_: 18.191.144.56

## Step 1: AWS Lightsail Registration
Follow the default setup for a Ubuntu instance on AWS at https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/  
Upon completion, download the default .pem private key provided by Amazon on your Account Page, and use this to SSH login as ubuntu user.  

## Step 2: Update Packages
Because we have just initialized a new machine in the cloud, it is safe to immediately update all packages on the OS. Do this by running the following:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
At this point, if the Ubuntu prompt states that a restart is required, run
```
sudo reboot
```
and then log back in from your host machine via ssh (remember to use the -i parameter with your .pem key)
